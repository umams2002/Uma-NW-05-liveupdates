""" 
Purpose: Provide continuous and reactive output for the MT Cars dataset.

- Use inputs from the UI Sidebar to filter the dataset.
- Update reactive outputs in the UI Main Panel.

Matching the IDs in the UI Sidebar and function/output names in the UI Main Panel
to this server code is critical. They are case sensitive and must match exactly.

------------------------------------
Important Concept - Variable Scope
------------------------------------
In Python, the scope of a variable refers to where in the code that variable 
can be accessed and used. 

Variables defined outside of functions or blocks have global scope 
and can be used anywhere in the file. 

Variables defined inside a function or block have local scope 
and can only be used within that specific function or block.

------------------------------------
Important Concept - Reactivity
------------------------------
Reactive Effects only have "side effects" (they set reactive values, but don't return anything directly).
Reactive Calcs return a value (they can also set reactive values).
If a reactive.Effect depends on inputs, you must add them using the
reactive.event decorator (otherwise, the function won't be triggered).

WorkFlow for Continuous and Interactive Apps

Step 1. Define the UI Inputs

1. Think: what can the user change?
2. Add new user inputs - define them in the ui_inputs.py file

Step 2. What continuous updates do you need? (Not UI driven)

These changes are not triggered by user input, but happen continuously
Write the functions needed and call them once to test them. 
Much of this work occurs outside the Shiny framework. 

For this example, we want to illustrate continuous updates
1. Using a function that returns a number (it can be anything)
2. Using web requests to the Open Weather API
3. Using web requests to the Yahoo Finance API

In this example, see these new files:
mtcars_constants.py - for basic functions outside Shiny
mtcars_get_temps.py - for continuous updates from the Open Weather API
mtcars_get_prices.py - for continuous updates from the Yahoo Finance API
These are all data-related - nothing to do with Shiny. 
Write and test these files separately. 

Step 3. Define the UI Outputs

1. Think: what does the user want to see?
2. For temperatures
    - We want a string to display the location and lat and long
    - We want a table to display the temperatures
    - We want a chart to display the temperatures

3. For company stock prices
    - We want a string to display the company and ticker
    - We want a table to display the prices
    - We want a chart to display the prices

4. Add these to the UI Outputs - define them in the ui_outputs.py file

Use the UI to verify each step. Get the input, lookup the lat/long, and show it in the output.
Show your tables first - this clarifies column names and data types.
Then you'll have what you need to make the charts work best.

Step 4. Define the Server Functions

1. Think: what do you need to do to create the outputs?
2. We wanted a reusable filtered df to drive the table and charts
3. Now, we need to add the continuous updates to the server function

2. Then, incorporate these inputs into the server function
3. Define reactive values - things you care about like the filtered df
   And the continuously updating dfs for temperatures and prices 
3. In the As you create outputs, add them to the return list
4. Add them to the output UI

IMPORTANT: All output functions must either depend on a input 
or a reactive value - either because the user changed something or because the reactive.invalidate_later() was called to update it continuously.
